# Professional Village Mod

**Minecraft Fabric 1.21.4 Mod**

This mod upgrades normal Minecraft villages to “professional villages” with new professions and structures.

## Features

- Adds an “Engineer” villager profession (workstation: Redstone Block)
- Villagers can become Engineers if a Redstone Block is available in a village
- Foundation for custom village generation and upgrades

## Setup

- Requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) for Minecraft 1.21.4
- Place in your mods folder after building

## How to Test

1. Enter a village in Minecraft.
2. Place a Redstone Block in the village.
3. Any unemployed villager may become an Engineer (with the new profession, though no trades yet).

## Next Steps

- Add more professional professions (Architect, Guard, etc.)
- Override village structure generation (see Fabric’s structure hooks)
- Create new building blocks and items
- Add villager AI improvements and custom trades
